	  <h3>St. Augustine of Hippo</h3>
	<h4>Summary of Key Context:</h4>
	<p>St. Augustine worked on his contributions in theology and philosophy during the fall of Rome, focusing on things that he deemed eternally relevant rather than on things that would eventually end. When Rome fell, it was a question whether to attribute it to the rise of Christianity at that time. Augustine believes it was the rise of Roman’s corruption and desire to dominate that lead to the demise of the seemingly unbreakable empire. He commented that the man's intrinsic goodness was tainted with the original sin of the first people on earth - Adam and Eve. Thus, humans can never attain perfect order as we all succumb into worldly desires. This then encourages not to worry much in this perfect order (since we certainly cannot by nature) but instead focus on atoning for our sins and live righteously.</p>

	<p>This sin results in eternal damnation we are all destined to be but there is hope. Augustine believes that through the grace of God there is salvation. This then separates the righteous and the unrighteous when the Kingdom of God comes – the heavenly city and the earthly city. The heavenly city inherits the Kingdom reigning eternally with God whereas the earthly city will suffer eternal punishment with the devil. Further, true justice comes from our love of Christ, from which comes our love for other people. That love for others allows us to treat them justly ("assign to each his due") and consequently, brings peace. Although Augustine believes on the separation of church and state, the State is still an instrument of divine justice and should focus on creating opportunities for Christian virtues to flourish.</p>

	<h4>View on Human Nature</h4>
	<p>Augustine believes that all of God’s creations are intrinsically good. However, this was tainted with the fall of the first people on earth, Adam and Eve. This original sin, as he called, is passed from generations to generations. All born of Adam are then subjected to innate sinful nature brought about by this fall at the Garden of Eden. </p>

	<p>The fall results in humans' limited capacity to attain the ideal political order. Humans, having the freedom to choose between good and evil, turned into becoming self-interested and materialistic. Our human tendency to serve our own interest and commit sin cannot be sufficiently reined in by reason, but requires the divine grace of God to overcome. This pessimistic view of Augustine to human virtues comes from his focus on the eternal things with which he deemed more relevant, reigning with God when His Kingdom finally comes. This belief shifts the pursuit of man from the ideal to living righteously and atoning for our sins.
</p>

	<p>St. Augustine separates humans into those who live in accordance to human laws and those in accordance to God's laws. The former is a person who lets their lust for power and other worldly things spread evil (but some righteous ones have desires that do not match Christian beliefs), while the latter is a transformed person who lives a life of devotion to God and temporarily lives to later on be admitted to the heavenly kingdom.</p>

	<p><b>Relevance:</b> The idea of the fallen man from its original design which is perfect and good offers a plausible explanation behind the existence of sufferings and death. Perhaps one has asked why we are not born in the already ideal state as preached by Plato and strive for this as we live our lives. The corrupted design manifests itself in the form of evil deeds such as theft, rape, murder and many others. Further, the original design may be the root of how we were able to perceive the good from the bad. For instance, one may also ask why do we have to develop the list of human rights and where this idea is coming from. Augustine has the answer&mdash;we were made in the likeness of God.</p>

	<h4>View on Salvation</h4>
	<p>The original sin of the first parents placed humanity into a position of eternal punishment with the devil. With the departure from God’s original design because of the fall, human’s will can no longer be in accordance to God by its own and requires His divine intervention – salvation.</p>

	<p>God, recognizing human’s free will, offered salvation for all of those who believed in Him.  Augustine believed this can be achieved when someone lives in faith to God, lives alongside the earthly kingdom but not being dragged into its worldly pleasures, and ultimately glorify Him and not the self. This salvation only comes by God’s grace (which leads to repentance and faith) and is not guaranteed by participation in the church nor even faith (i.e. faith does not necessarily guarantee salvation). This results in a division of the human race – the heavenly city that consists of those who live according to God and the earthly city that consists of those who live according to man. The heavenly city is destined to reign eternally with God free from the hardships of this world whereas the earthly city is still bound to its impending doom..</p>

	<p>Augustine believed in the doctrine of predestination, meaning to say that God, in his omniscience, has already chosen people who will be saved. However, the sovereignty of God is reconciled with the idea of human agency and free will by understanding that God has given us free will to choose our actions, and therefore we are responsible for our own sins.</p>

	<p><b>Relevance:</b> The gift of salvation gives purpose and hope. It offers the idea of a second chance in the next life under the divine governance of the eternal King, cleansed from all forms of evil and hardships. This then encourages one to live a good life that even those who do not conform to the church can benefit.</p>

	<h4>View on State and Church</h4>
	<p>Man's natural and strong inclination to sin meant that laws should be strictly put in place by the State to keep us in check. The State was an instrument of divine justice but should also focus on creating opportunities for Christian virtues to flourish. Humans being social animals, the State creates these opportunities by providing peace. It mediates conflicts in the City of Man but is unfortunately imperfect due to the limitations of human judgment.</p>
	<p>The Church, on the other hand, is the symbol of the City of God. Augustine thought that this church serves as the agency on earth to guide every man to a rightful living and makes them worthy of entry to the eternal kingdom. A member of a church treats himself as a stranger here on earth, a sojourner, meant to reign with God in His kingdom.</p>
	<p>The Church and the State are to be separate, but the Church should give sound advice to the rulers of the State. However, people are to obey the State regardless of their brand of justice.</p>
	<p><b>Relevance:</b> The vast majority of the Philippine population are Christians. Thereby their contributions in the state is certainly immense. For instance, the bloc voting tradition of Iglesia ni Cristo significantly affects the results of elections with over a million of voting members. Further, church leaders, albeit not endorsing specific candidates, encourage their members to vote with conscience and consult their decisions to God. The church as well, no matter what congregation, engage in their own charitable works.
On the other hand, the fact that most Filipinos are Christians gives rise to debates on issues such as divorce laws and LGBTQ+ community related concerns. 
</p>
	
	<h4>View on Justice</h4>
	<p>Augustine believes that our right relation to God which he referred to as justice is a prerequisite for peace. It manifests when everything is in its natural order, particularly when humans obey the laws of God. Such relation to God preserves the natural order from which peace eventually follows. It produces harmony within the society, and it begins within each person.</p>
	<p>True justice comes from our love of Christ, in His words and love, from which comes our love for other people. That love for others allows us to treat them justly ("assign to each his due").</p>
	<p><b>Relevance:</b> Everyone desires peace. The brotherly universal love that Christianity upholds is unconditional. It keeps humanity intact treating each other with rightful intimacy, instead of pure objective view as older philosophers believed. It also agrees to the natural desire of humans to feel loved and accepted as we all, in contemporary times, have learned to acknowledge.</p>

	<h3>St. Thomas of Aquinas</h3>
	<h4>Summary of Key Context</h4>
	<p>St. Thomas of Aquinas lived in a time when Christianity needed to cement itself as a religion that would last for a long time. Much of his works are a synthesis of Aristotle’s rediscovered works, which he used as an instrument to reaffirm the institutionalization of Christianity. Unlike the Augustinian preference to Plato, St. Thomas needed something that was more adaptable and can stand the test of time, which is exhibited by the inquisitive yet careful writings of Aristotle. The flexibility of Aristotle allowed Christianity as a religion to persevere through the ages. It was also vital that St. Thomas combined faith and reason through scholasticism so that Christianity would be more resistant to arguments from humanism; human reasoning was becoming so popular that he had to incorporate it into the Christian doctrine instead of reject it altogether.</p>
	<p>St. Thomas was devoted to Christianity, so much so that he was compelled to write a series of books that explain the principle beliefs of Christianity and use it to discuss important topics in humanity. He was able to do so since he was exposed to the Christian life early on by the mendicant Dominicans, who compelled him to stay away from his aristocratic life. This early devotion fueled his long and triumphant attempt to reconcile Aristotelian thought with Christian beliefs.</p>
	
	<h4>View on Human Nature</h4>
	<p>Humans possess reasoning so as to participate in implementing God’s eternal law in the world (namely the natural law). Because of this, humans have an innate sense of goodness in them. This, however, is not enough to achieve ultimate goodness because human reasoning has its limitations. This limitation can only be perfected through God’s guidance, either through the teachings of Christianity or through divine revelation in the form of the Bible. St. Thomas reconciled reason and faith by stating that faith stands more superior than reason but they are complementary; reason guided with faith is the best type of person for St. Thomas.</p>
	<p><b>Relevance:</b> This affirmation of reasoning with faith shows that there is no conflict between religious beliefs and logic. This naturally extends to the domains of both science and religion, in that science tries to understand the world and religion provides the context that cannot be explained by science. A lot of extremist views on science versus religion fail to acknowledge this and instead disposes one in favor of another without realizing that it is perfectly fine for them to coexist. St. Thomas reminds us that we need both and not just one or the other and that these types of arguments are completely meaningless.</p>
	
	<h4>View on Salvation</h4>
	<p>There are various forms of salvation, which for St. Thomas is the achievement of that which is good and is worth pursuing. There are material goods that humans are better off trying to obtain, such as wealth and virtue, while the ultimate good of being with God is far more valuable than any material goods. This form of salvation is worth pursuing because it transcends the mortal appetite and leads to eternal happiness.</p>
	<p><b>Relevance:</b> St. Thomas tells us that we must seek for the good that is beyond ourselves. This salvation is a strong driving force for propagating good in the world, especially in times of grievance where seemingly all is lost. Majority of people in the Philippines suffer through poverty, but their character and devotion to God makes them richer than the oligarchs that run the country, for they enjoy their wealth of being with God in the afterlife. This, in a way, gives the idea that we should strive to be like these people who do good despite all odds.</p>
	
	<h4>View on State and Church</h4>
	<p>St. Thomas views the church as superior to the state, as the state merely aims to achieve the common good and maintain order, whereas the church seeks to achieve the ultimate good of being with God. However, it is not possible to aim for the final goal without first maintaining peace in the community, so the government must first seek the needs of the common good while being advised by the church.</p>
	<p><b>Relevance:</b> It is quite common to hear conflicts between the church and the state, especially when it concerns controversial policies. While it is certainly true that the government may want to enact practical policies that go against the teachings of the church, and that the church tries to warn the administration of the consequences of undermining their doctrines, it is necessary that they work together to unify the citizens rather than divide them based on the strength of their faith. Moreover, the church must assist the state in preventing the implementation of unjust laws that would lead to suffering. As the saying goes, not all that is legal is moral, but then again, modern perspectives tend to go against the timeless and unchanging teachings of religion.</p>
