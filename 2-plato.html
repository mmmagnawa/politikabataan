	  <h3>Platonic Values</h3>
	<p>According to Plato, there are four cardinal virtues of human excellence namely wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. As humans, we have the capacity to associate these virtues to anything within the scope of our senses. These can range from the simplest to the most unique or extraordinary symbols of these virtues, but they have the same purpose of reminding us that we are humans who are capable of achieving excellence.</p>
	<h4>Wisdom is guidance.</h4>
	<p>Unlike knowledge which can be taught, measured, and learned, wisdom can only be discovered through experience. It needs us to get through the very core of knowledge such that we can apply these through critical thinking and decision making.</p>

	<p>The essence of wisdom can be found in shoes, wherein wearing it means we are ready to face the world, and to expose ourselves to society. In addition, wisdom can also be associated with a light bulb, wherein the illuminance it brings when the switch is on reminds us that we must open our eyes to see through every situation, and that we are capable of making judgements on our own.</p>
	
	<h4>Courage is liberty.</h4>
	<p>Courage, on the other hand, is getting out of the box; of our comfort zones. The desperation for liberty&mdash;from our ideas to be transformed into words or for us to explore and go for an adventure may haunt our beings. However, it is important to note that courage does not equate to recklessness nor to excessive confidence. Hence, we must be able to assess every situation, also through critical thinking and understanding.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless, we are humans who also get tired, and choosing to rest does not mean weakness nor cowardice. Rather, it also enunciates courage; thus, it can also be symbolized by a pillow. We may not even be aware, but it takes a tremendous amount of courage and trust to lay your head upon your pillow as you fall into slumber, never certain if you will witness the next day. To sleep is to remain vigilant because we are at our most vulnerable. In doing so, we challenge the fear of the unknown, even if we are oblivious to the fact.</p>
	<h4>Temperance is balance.</h4>
	<p>What makes humans unique is our free will, but the challenge for us is how we should find the balance in it. Moderation is tricky, and most importantly, it is subjective. It also requires a strong sense of responsibility.</p>

	<p>Therefore, the virtue of temperance can be embodied by a refrigerator and how it is tempting to open; however, it is not the fridge that sets its limit, but we can as the master of ourselves. Additionally, a bed would always seem to sparkle in just one sight. It is truly hard to resist the pulling force of the bed, but we should know when to detach ourselves from it and proceed with our businesses.</p>
	<h4>Justice is social stability.</h4>
	<p>Humans are very much considered social creatures, and social communication and interaction is what makes justice. Moreover, within this virtue is our involvement and contribution. This reminds us of our power that is accompanied with responsibilities.</p>

	<p>ITherefore, the virtue of justice can be signified by a sewing machine. Each part of this machinery contributes to the output as whole even if it appears to be to each its own. The workload may seem to be divided unequally, having the needle to seemingly do most of the work, but in actuality, no matter how small the work is perceived to be, without each part's proper coordination, the function of the sewing machine shall falter. To do your own purpose is and will aid in the purpose of others.</p> <br>
