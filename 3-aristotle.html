	  <h3>Good Life in the Golden Mean</h3>
	<p>It comes to no surprise that as intellectual beings and as time passes by, we come to realizations that we inevitably uphold in our ways of living. When we come across having to figure out how to temper ourselves and with society, we reach varying degrees of understanding as to what that entails. Continuing to build our own morality and virtues can be challenging especially in analysing and maintaining a proper equilibrium with regards to these.</p>

<p>Virtue is a systematic belief that we can easily develop individually, taking our own personal experiences into lessons that we use to understand life. In a sense, we examine and determine what are righteous behaviours in an objective manner by comparing it to certain criteria that we have created. We, as a society, also possess a set of criteria that objectively outlines what is morally acceptable within a given community, such criteria are represented by government laws, social norms and cultural traditions. In this manner, one can justify that there is a system in place in order for us to regulate ourselves and reach equilibrium.</p>

<p>The systems in place that influences our moral understandings are, at best, a mere guide. Due to our differences in personality, cultural upbringing, familial situations, relationships, childhood, privileges, and the like, the construction of these systematic beliefs that are seemingly objective is revealed to be as subjective as can be. In another perspective, these are all merely elaborate and ordered opinions that reached a consensus within society.</p>

<p>Despite the premise of it being subjective, stubbornly keeping values this way can inhibit and narrow our own understanding of our constructed virtues. We are not born with all the knowledge of the universe, but instead, we are beings that continuously grow not just physically but intellectually and emotionally as well. As we are subject to commit mistakes, it becomes not just our responsibility but also the responsibility of those around us to deliberate and re-examine the scope of authority that our values possess and if they are ones that benefit not only the self, but to the community as well. Thus, it is imperative to interact with others to stimulate the discourse and to elevate our understanding over what we currently know about how the world works and how we should function within it.</p>

<p>Understanding is, of course, only the first step in achieving that equilibrium. Our actions impact the very core of our ideologies and such is what needs supervising. The world continues to innovate and progress and the scope of what our virtues encompasses expands with it. Our individual situations change, and as such, our virtues get tweaked or even overhauled in the process to accommodate the new experiences. Reaching equilibrium then becomes not a goal but a way of life that we must constantly strive to pursue.</p>

<p>As long as we have the capability to change, the hustle for equilibrium never stops and, ironically, balances ourselves in the process. This is how it comes to the conclusion that living our lives the way we think we morally should and pursuing equilibrium becomes a virtue in and of itself.</p>
