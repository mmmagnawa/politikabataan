				<h3>BAIT-IT, Abigail C.</h3>
				<p>A scientist in the making who believes in the objectivity of science and the reality of the things she sees and cannot see, from the tiniest quarks to stars and massive black holes. A person who is in constant battle with one's fear of failure that results in inactive participation on discourses that requires critical and philosophical thinking. Aware of her unproductive mindset, she tries to embrace that the evolution of ideas is a product of trial and error and gives room to criticisms as part of learning.</p>

				<h3>LAO, Pierre Romayne S.</h3>
				<p>A student who would like to both literally and figuratively delve on the surface of the earth, as a Geodetic Engineering major. Although discoveries in the field would largely come from mathematics, she believes that the art of critical thinking must be manifested when seeking for improvement and reaching out to society. She also enjoys silence, but never of those from the enablers.</p>

				<h3>LUNA, Jack Michael A.</h3>
				<p>An experienced theatre arts student that immerses himself into the depths of philosophy, music, and language. The arts have empowered his scope of perspectives, sharing a link to the different realities of everyday life. He lives life as his own experiment, figuring out what dynamics work best and what experiences can spark new philosophical ideas. Communication may very well be his most adept weapon in his arsenal and his lethargic tendencies may just be his own kryptonite. Nonetheless, the ideas never stop.</p>

				<h3>MAGNAWA, Marc Cyrel M.</h3>
				<p>I am currently taking undergraduate physics and taking a deep dive into its mystery and formalism. I have taken interest in trying to comprehend the natural world through the use of mathematical rigor. I tend to be neutral and independent in the absence of compelling information and try to piece together the story before forming an opinion at the cost of having any strong convictions.</p>

				<h3>REMPILLO, Rowill Christian R.</h3>
				<p>A BS Mechanical Engineering student that relies partially in intuition and partially on pre-established knowledge. For me, the idea of “thinking” is one of the most complex ideas that ever existed, that is, there’s no centralized system or repository of thoughts that govern the notion of thinking – it’s limitless. I always had a fair share of the struggles and fears of critical thinking and public speaking but experience always tells me that the biggest ideas, thriving talents and life-changing innovations have come from those who started from the bottom, those who struggled to go out into the world, and those who have overruled the fears and pressures brought by society.</p>

				<h3>SUICO, John Samuel O.</h3>
				<p>Currently an undergraduate BS Physics student with a passion for computational physics, high fantasy and politics. My primary struggle and objective is remaining true to my faith while understanding more about the complexities of both the universe and society. Nevertheless, I don’t take myself too seriously, but am willing to go the extra mile for my interests. Firmly believes that the political responsibility of a citizen extends far beyond that of the norms of a representative democracy and that community engagement is the key to progress.</p>
