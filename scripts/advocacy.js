document.write("<h4>Don’t strip the children of their futures.</h4><p>Child trafficking for exploitation has been a problem in several countries, especially in the developing ones. These trafficked children have been used for several purposes including prostitution, forced labor, organ harvesting, illegal adoption, and begging (Deb, Sunny, & Majumdar, 2020).</p><p>Children’s commodification is a blatant violation of their rights. They are the most vulnerable in our society, and they unsolicitedly require utmost protection against offenders and/or exploiters. Their innocence must never be in any manner taken advantage of as no child should be susceptible to such heinous crimes and activities in the first place. It is the state’s and the society’s responsibility to prevent child trafficking through community awareness; and to nourish a healthy breeding ground for children because they are the seeds of the upcoming generations. In the end, safeguarding them, at all costs, does not only morally portray upholding our roles as good citizens, but most importantly, ensures them a better future in the best possible means.</p>");
