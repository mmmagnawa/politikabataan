I don\'t know to you but I easily find long forwarded messages in my clan\'s group chat that spread fake news. One of which is the claim that inhaling hot salt water steam can kill SARS-COV-2, the culprit behind this pandemic. According to the message, this was the method done in China that successfully helped them against the disease. We may have been able to identify this as fake news on the first read yet according to a Rappler article that fact checked the claim, the source Facebook video has reached over 11M views, 467,000 shares, 233,000 reactions, and 12,000 comments [1].</p><p> Another interesting and fun thing to check is the truthfulness of some 5-minute Crafts[2] and Bright Side[3] videos. 5-minute Crafts have over 68.2M subscribers as of writing while BRIGHT SIDE sits on 36.4M subscribers and their videos are reaching over millions. For an instance, we have undoubtedly stumbled upon personality and signs of intelligence videos. While they may be entertaining to watch, some of its contents are certainly misleading. Some topics do not just have a direct answer and can be inaccurate albeit the use of “scientists says”, “research says that” and the like. Further, the studies cited in their videos are not mentioned in the video descriptions. </p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>[1] FALSE: Salt water steam can cure coronavirus.

Putanginang COVID na \'yan, \'di uubra \'yan diyan. Totoo, if you want disinfection, maghanap ka ng gasolina. Babad mo \'yung kamay mo. Layo mo lang, huwag sa loob ng bahay \'nyo."</p><p>Conclusion: There has been no proof that washing masks with diesel and gasoline can help sterilize it for the purpose of reusing it. Several agencies, like the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have released a list of disinfectants for controlling the virus – which does not include diesel and gasoline. Harmful effects also occur in prolonged exposure and inhalation of gasoline. The World Health Organization (WHO) also said that surgical masks cannot be reused twice.</p><p>Another ill-informed research that has been circulating in social media is the information regarding consuming more ‘alkaline food above the virus’ pH level’ (see picture below).</p><p>Conclusion: There has been no proof that consuming more alkaline food above the pH level of the virus will be effective in fighting COVID-19. Also, the pH level is a measure of acidity that only ranges from 0 to 14. Most of the pH levels indicated are not correct. </p><img src="images/forums/phlevel.jpg"><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>CNN Philippines Staff. (31 July 2020).

According to Medical News Today, inhaling gasoline vapors can cause irritation in the sensitive lung tissues, allowing harmful chemicals to enter the blood stream, and causing healthy tissues to die. Even exposure to gasoline vapor can cause dizziness, headache, difficulty in breathing and heart failure.</p><p>Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend reusing disposable face masks, as they will not be as effective for protection against the virus.

To make it sound more interesting, people who share raw information from scientists may attempt to add something that could excite the reader on the implications of such a report. Unfortunately, they could accidentally misrepresent the information they are trying to present. Granted, this may not be as significant as some of the more pressing issues in our country, but there is still some value in investigating such subtleties. After all, misleading information is not always obvious.</p><p>There is renewed interest in Venus due to recent findings of phosphine gas in the planet\'s atmosphere [1], a chemical only produced in large amounts in the lab and by living organisms. This is not conclusive evidence that there is or was life on Venus, but in one Reddit post [2], the post title claimed that it is "a strong indicator of life on Venus." In the comments, the poster showsed some skepticism towards the existence of life on Venus, but the post with the misleading title still has about two thousand upvotes.</p><p>It is also possible that news can end up being misleading if information is compressed. The headline of a highly compressed news bit from Manila Times [3] incorrectly cites scientists for claiming an unverified statement that there is indeed life on Venus. This is a small detail, but in news articles the headline is the most valuable element and so it should at least be factual.</p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>[1] Greaves, Jane S., Anita M.

These platforms have liberalized the process of information dissemination into a democratic setting where people have the power to consume, produce, and share as much information as anyone else (Nagi, 2018). However, this has also led to the alarming yet all-too-well-known phenomenon we all know as "fake news". </p><p>The spread of false information, which occasionally might seem harmless in its inception, always has the potential to become malicious and even life threatening to the people who believe it. This has become especially relevant in our current situation where COVID-19 continues to run rampant throughout the world. At a time where people have to deal with the economic and social instabilities brought about by the pandemic, fake news regarding the seriousness of the disease, lack of effectivity of masks and potential cures for the virus have made the front page of our Facebook walls and Twitter timelines (Vazquez &amp; Kelly, 2020; Fleming 2020, Mendoza, 2020)</p><p>I can personally relate to the confusion these posts have made as potential cures, such as \'saging\' and \'mangosteen\', have made their way into discussions at the dinner table. These posts have made me uncomfortable enough that I\'ve had to fact check by listening to established podcasts like \'Science Vs\' to get proper information with actual citation of sources. However, that method of approach comes from someone with a background in scientific research. When it comes to the spread of fake news, shouldn\'t the moderators of our social media platforms be culpable as well? </p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>[1] Vazquez, M. &amp; Kelly, C.

With the overwhelming amount of freedom an individual has to access these data, one should be careful in determining its credibility.</p><p>The sources I\'ve gathered showed an explicit use of the names of educational institutions to use as a tool for persuasion in order to appear credible. A clear example of this would be a circulating image of a paragraph full of jumbled words claiming that a study from Cambridge University proves a psycholinguistic function of the brain, but upon further research, a faculty member from the university itself has declared that there was never such study from them. Much like the previous example, another image claims that a study from the University of Oxford proves that having a big butt contributes to a more intelligent offspring. A search through the university\'s database shows an existing article that features body fat distribution but lacks any reference to the image\'s claims. Lastly, a recent photo claiming an alleged BS Dentistry student of UPLB is now dead and declared as NPA has circulated in Facebook wherein the user stated that the student was apparently brainwashed by the NPA and has wasted his life in the process. It has been noted thereafter that UPLB does not even possess a dentistry course.</p><p>It is easy for people to be mislead and manipulated by adding a credible source in claims but, in turn, it makes it significantly harder for society to sift through the truth of reality and diminishes the habit of proper academic resource dissemination in the process.</p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>Davis, Matt. “Aoccdrnig to a Rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, It Deosn\'t Mttaer in Waht Oredr the Ltteers in a Wrod Are, the Olny Iprmoetnt Tihng Is Taht the Frist and Lsat Ltteer Be at the Rghit Pclae.
