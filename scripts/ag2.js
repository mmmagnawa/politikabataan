A cook book can help you do your recipes and to be knowledgeable about it and the kitchen. The ability to mix or improve what\'s in the cook book is called wisdom.</p><p><b>Courage: splattering cooking oil</b></p><p>Those who have tried frying know the struggle against splattering cooking oil. But the need to cook at that instance pushes one to continue the chore. In Plato’s The Republic, Socrates referred courage as the “power of preserving” the right conviction on things which ought or not ought to be feared in all circumstances[1]. Despite the pain from the splattering oil, a courageous person will continue.</p><p><b>Temperance: refrigerator</b></p><p>It is very tempting to open our fridge from time to time. We munch and munch as we do our requirements in this online learning setup. The fridge doesn\'t or cannot limit itself but we can. Indeed, we are the master of ourselves.</p><p><b>Justice: sound system</b></p><p>To Plato, when three elements (reason, spirit, appetite) work in harmony together with reason ruling the other two, there is justice in the individual. I\'d like to associate this to our sound system here at home. The DVD player rules the amplifier and speakers as it contains the CD to be played. It sort of decides what comes out as a sound. The amplifier submits to the DVD player and together control the speakers, the appetite.[2] Further, each component minds its own business as what Socrates said in the dialogue[1].</p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>[1] Ebenstein, William, and Alan O.

When the switch is not turned on, the surrounding’s dark and the area is not visible. In an opposite manner, having the vision with the things around you, you’re more capable of comparing two distinct objects, see through the situation, make carefully thought decisions, and acquire improved critical thinking.</p><p>Candle for me symbolizes courage. Candles are made of wax material and a wick that vaporizes over time, while serving a particular purpose. Relating it to real life, there are people who gets burnt out, tired, depressed, or sad, but they still stood by their purpose, pledge, and service to the people. #SaveOurMedicalFrontliners</p><p>Don’t we all agree that a bed really symbolizes temperance? When we’re tired, we lie down. When we’re not tired, we still lie down. I also believe that majority of people are productive when they resist the pulling force of the bed. Being able to resist that is such a talent.</p><p>The last symbolism is the round table for justice. In the famous literary piece, ‘Knights of the Round Table’ in the mid-12th century, the round table was a symbol for equality. An article posted in encyclopedia.com discussed the difference between a king sitting at the top of a royal table and a king sitting on a round table with his knights – equality. It also says that no one is above anyone else and that there’s an established rule that governs this.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>(21 September 2020). Round Table.

However, wisdom is gained through experience, thus I associate this virtue to shoes. It is because once we wear it, we are exposing ourselves to the world, apply our knowledge and make decisions.</p><p>Courage: Laptop</p><p>Since classes for this semester are conducted online, I can associate the virtue of courage to my laptop. It is because once I open it, I need to do my best to learn in this set up and submit my requirements, as much as possible within the deadline. It is indeed difficult but I need to do it to move forward.</p><p>Temperance: Bed</p><p>Whenever I feel I am about to burst due to stress, I would drop everything and proceed to my bed. It definitely feels as if my bed is comforting me; however, I should know when to detach myself from it and get back to work.</p><p>Justice: Dining table</p><p>Our family can only eat together during dinner, and it is an everyday heart-warming time for us because each of us share how our day went. We also have our own tasks before and after eating— who would cook, prepare the table, and wash the dishes.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Marc Cyrel Magnawa</i></h4><p>I have chosen four rather bizarre items to represent each of Plato\'s four cardinal virtues, but I think these comparisons are reasonably appropriate.</p><p>Wisdom is embodied by the <b>refrigerator</b>. It houses a variety of ingredients and other types of food. Having an abundance of consumables is good, but its full potential can only be realized if someone with the right experience stores and selects ingredients that work well together. Similarly, wisdom is only manifested if one uses experience to effectively utilize the knowledge they have gathered.</p><p>The knife represents <b>courage</b>, for it is both a tool and a weapon. The knife is equipped with a plastic handle to protect its user, and a sharp blade to cut anything it encounters. This discernment between what must be protected and what must be sliced is reflective of the virtue it represents.</p><p>Temperance, then, is represented by <b>milk</b>. At our home, we currently have fresh milk, which we restock only occasionally. Therefore, it is necessary to consume or use only the appropriate amount so that there is enough milk to last for a while.</p><p>Finally, I chose the <b>blender</b> to represent justice; similar to how Plato\'s concept of justice can only exist when the other three virtues are present and can fulfill their own roles, the blender can only produce delicious shake if everything has served its purpose correctly. Such is not possible without carefully selecting the fruits that synergize together, skillfully cutting the said fruits, and mixing in the right amount of milk.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Jack Michael Luna</i></h4><p>Wisdom - Cabinet</p><p>A cabinet is basically akin to an empty canvass. As you place a variety of objects within it, its purpose changes as it begins to transform as a clothes cabinet, a shoe cabinet, a cosmetics cabinet, or others in its likeness. Like with our minds, the more we take in, we ultimately transform ourselves as we obtain knowledge, and in turn, engage with it unto whatever purpose we deem it to have, such is wisdom.</p><p>Courage - Pillow</p><p>We may not even be aware but it takes a tremendous amount of courage and trust to lay your head upon your pillow as you fall into slumber, never certain if you will witness the next day. To sleep is to remain vigilant because we are at our most vulnerable. In doing so, we challenge the fear of the unknown, even if we are oblivious to the fact.</p><p>Temperance - Ice Cube</p><p>An ice cube is one of the objects that exemplifies the epitome of temperate balance. It is no shock to any of us to see that when the surrounding temperature reaches its melting point, it will be unable to maintain its form and structure and will inevitably fall apart. An uncommon observation is to see it under extreme cold conditions. An ice cube not only maintains itself but also stubbornly roots itself to whatever it can, hindering whatever progress or even purpose it may yet achieve. To be whole and with purpose, a balance of many conditions must be met consistently.</p><p>Justice - Sewing Machine</p><p>Each part of this machinery contributes to the output as whole even if it appears to be to each its own. The workload may seem to be divided unequally, having the needle to seemingly do most of the work, but in actuality, no matter how small the work is perceived to be, without each part\'s proper coordination, the function of the sewing machine shall falter. To do your own purpose is and will aid in the purpose of others. I believe that is justice.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>John Samuel Suico</i></h4><p>Wisdom - My mother\'s posters</p><p>Around the start of high school, my mother had made it a point to print out and stick random posters containing bible verses around the house and in our room. To my understanding, these random verses had struck my mother enough that she determined that they should never be out of sight. Plato presented wisdom to be prudent counsel that could be used to govern the whole of the state (which in this case, seems to be analogous with my family) in its external and internal relations. These posters, I believe, certainly try to impute counsel to that effect.</p><p>Courage - The Bible</p><p>This may seem redundant, but to me, the Bible does seem like the best representation for courage. It represents and establishes my faith in Christ which in turn preserves my conviction of that which I should be afraid of - God or man. That courage leads me to the defense of that conviction, by manner of walking the talk.</p><p>Justice - doors within the house</p><p>Having 7 people within the house, it tends to be quite difficult to preserve a space solely for oneself. Our doors within the house function as barriers of entry which are used to signify minding one\'s own business. </p><p>Temperance - my phone</p><p>I have a lot of apps in my phone that I use on a daily basis to pass time, but I\'ve come to the point where it\'s difficult for me to remain productive because I easily get distracted. However, I\'ve also recently established a productivity boosting app that focuses on rationing my time wisely, so I think my struggle with temperance is entirely encapsulated by my phone.</p>')
