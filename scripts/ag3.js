Now, think of a scenario where you excessively pursuing this virtue will be frowned upon by society. Likewise, imagine an occasion where lacking this virtue will be detrimental to you and society well-being. Share your reflections on this with your groupmates. </p><hr><h2>Virtues</h2><h4>Rempillo: <b>Commitment</b></h4><p>We don’t always associate commitment with everything that we do – sometimes we only do things to comply, etc. If everyone has commitment in everything that they do, maybe outcomes would be a lot better. Imagine if innovators would push their ideas and turn them into reality – flying cars isn’t really impossible by this time. Turning ideas into reality requires a lot of commitment. Also, in our situation right now, if there’s no commitment in studies, graduating or earning a degree is definitely a lot harder. Especially in these hard times, doing requirements, passing exams and all, requires a lot of commitment. Now, you’re doing great. Commitment is also progress.</p><h4>Bait-it: <b>Patience</b></h4><p>Admittedly, I am a person with low frustration tolerance. Especially now in this remote learning, my impatience seemed to be amplified even with the slightest form of irritation. I am very particular in time and I want to do things in the most optimum way possible. Not achieving this would lead me to just stopping what I\'m doing and procrastinate. Lacking this virtue, this would make me sabotage the things I\'m doing. I am well aware of this and so I keep on repeating to myself "patience, patience" or just take a shower and then continue where I left off after. Perhaps in the extreme case that one has a lot of patience, he/she might overwork himself or perhaps people would take advantage of it for their own good.</p><h4>Suico: <b>Optimism</b></h4><p>Every endeavor we undertake comes with the dichotomy of success or failure. In a purely statistical sense, it should then be expected that we are to fail as many times as we succeed. However, in my opinion, how we deal with these outcomes, whether it be in a positive or negative manner, strongly affects the results of our future undertakings. I personally would love to have an optimistic mindset, because I tend to feel worthless and exhausted after experiencing a setback, to the point of being unable to continue whatever it is that I was supposed to do. There is, however, a caveat, and one that I\'ve experienced myself. Being too optimistic, especially after a success, has also considerably slowed my progress down to the point where I find myself cramming a paper to the very last second of the deadline, even after having an early start. And yet, in cases where we need optimism, such as after failing an exam, it\'s extremely important to remain in good spirits and have a resilient mindset, lest we dig ourselves a deeper hole than we are capable of climbing back up from.</p><h4>Ilao: <b>Humility</b></h4><p>Excessively pursuing humility may be interpreted by the society as me being fake, a conscious person, or as someone who fears to be criticized. They may also think of me as a pleaser just because there are eyes around me. Moreover, this virtue could be viewed by the society as being arrogant simply because they are displeased with how I react to sudden compliments or how I accept even the unpleasant comments. On the other hand, lacking this virtue could make my confidence soar extremely— thinking too highly of myself, defying critiques, ignoring different opinions, beliefs and perspectives, or even not stopping until I get the last word despite speaking nonsense at that point. With this, I can be perceived as someone who does not like people and their company, because they may think I will never be contented.</p><h4>Magnawa: <b>Confidence</b></h4><p>It is a necessity to be able to recognize one\'s own abilities so that they may be realized to their full potential. A crucial part of this is learning to accept who we are and recognizing what we can achieve as well as understanding our own limitations. To be able to trust themselves in any situation is the trademark of a confident person. There is, however, danger in thinking too highly of oneself, as this leads to arrogance; being confident to the point that you only consider yourself as capable or worthy of a task is detrimental to collaboration. On the other hand, being unable to trust one\'s capabilities can often lead to anxiety or self-doubt in the face of failure or uncertainty.</p><h4>Luna: <b>Honesty</b></h4><p>We all recognize the phrase “Honesty is the best policy,” but what does it actually entail? Honesty involves the revelation of truth and it may be true that, in some cases, the “truth hurts” and it may not be what is best at the current moment. Truth is a very important aspect in our lives that is the catalyst for our understanding and trust of the things we know, and at times it can be the catalyst for undesirable outcomes when utilized wrongly. For example, a person that always says what is on his/her mind can lead to situations where he/she can be offensive and thus generate unnecessary malice upon them. Lacking in honesty is a detriment as well for it denies those who require the truth their right of proper judgment. To balance these attributes in a manner that can be called as virtuous honesty, it is important to know when it is proper to reveal truths, when it should be withheld for the time being, and how it is articulated given the context of every situation encountered.</p><hr><h2>Discussion</h2><h4>Post by <i>Abigail Bait-it</i></h4><p>I deeply relate to the sentiments of my groupmates and somehow, I felt like we are on the same boat. Admittedly, we know that anything too much or too small is not good even without this discussion. Unfortunately, there exist no absolute weighing scale in life that determines the golden mean of the virtues. It is relative. Perhaps the extreme to others is just enough for the other. It all really boils down on how one drives his own life. However, approaching this golden mean is still possible.</p><p>I certainly think sometimes we do not have that much of an ability to view ourselves objectively. How will you know if you are going too much or vice versa? Pursuing the balance on such virtues, I believe, needs accountability perhaps from a close friend that you know and will help you grow. Even though you are on the extreme end of the introvert spectrum, you must admit that you depended on the opinions of others at some point in your life. Moreover, it is very easy to slack off when no one is watching. The beauty of accountability is that there is good pressure that keeps your momentum and at the same time no pressure from judgement. </p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Rowill Christian Rempillo</i></h4><p>The activity helped me assess the virtues that I want to connect with myself, where I lack most, and how to improve the way I approach actual situations, in general. I also realized that my group mates’ virtues also apply to me as a student, and as a member of a community.</p><p>Overall, I think almost all of our virtues are similar – driven by a particular goal. It enhances our vision to what we really want to happen or achieve, may it be short-term or long-term. It also shapes our mindsets to what is more important and what makes us more productive. I also believe that our virtues, commitment, patience, optimism and humility, are interdependent – that is, everything works hand in hand, or the collective version works much better than individualism.</p><p>For the difference, I think it’s hard to be committed with the things that you do if you do not possess these other virtues. It’s hard to see things in an optimum manner as it also affects how you weigh things. The two extremes that I associate with commitment is unproductive and aggressive. Not being committed enough feels like you’re just going with the flow, not challenged and sometimes discouraged. On the other hand, being very committed makes me aggressive like doing everything in a single run. The problem with this is, I’m easily frustrated when something wrong happens in the process and pushing myself too much that it stresses me out.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Pierre Ilao</i></h4><p>Based on our group’s sharing, I believe we all have our fears in the polars of the virtues that we pursue. I relate to them, especially with how I experience these extremes in taking care of my own being, maintaining my inner peace, as well as in interacting with the society. It is truly hard to evaluate where we are in this scale, or in the first place, is there even an absolute one, when each of us have different standards which come from our own beliefs, principles and experiences. Who are we to tell if someone did not do his/her best? If he/she did not think before the act? How could we really judge a person when we all have different pairs of shoes?</p><p>Therefore, as we seek for the golden mean of these virtues, it may be our own selves that we crucify. Rather than walking on eggshells to seek validation from the society, we can choose who to pursue these virtues for, but on top of that list should always be ourselves. We should continue to acknowledge our strengths and most especially our weaknesses to continue improving as an individual then consequently, a contributing and peace-loving member of the society.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Marc Cyrel Magnawa</i></h4><p>Much of the virtues in our group are grounded on personal experience and are also reflections of the types of virtues that we value. It is nonetheless fascinating to see where someone draws the line between virtue and vice (due to excess in a character or lack thereof). Some of these are influenced by how society perceives the individual, while some are derived from how we react (or at least how we ought to react) to challenges in life.</p><p>The idea of a virtue being a balance of two extremities displays how certain attitudes are not dangerous all the time. This fits nicely with my belief that anything, when taken to the extreme, becomes bad.</p><p>As we interact more with others, we better understand when we are showing too little of a character and when it is too much. As a result, we tweak our own attitudes to find the right balance. It requires effort to change an existing vice into something that is more acceptable not only to oneself but also the person\'s relationship with others, and I think learning where to find this balance and achieving it is crucial to preserving the things we value.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Jack Michael Luna</i></h4><p>Given generational culture we share, my companions have distinguished very relatable situations that correspond well to the communal perspective of the equilibrium of virtue. Although the virtues presented were varying, it all boiled down to achieving balance of priorities. But not only does focus become imperative to this as the habitual practice of it becomes of equal importance.</p><p>A pattern conceived by all of the reflections have made me conclude that all of these virtues can be realized by simply another virtue, which also governs itself, the virtue of restriction. It is by knowing the proper placement of boundaries shall one be able to identify how far one can go without venturing too deep into vices. Restriction in itself can also be considered its own virtue. To restrict the level of your restriction in any virtue, including restriction itself, is a paramount necessity to achieve equilibrium.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>John Samuel Suico</i></h4><p>In all of our answers, it was evident that we all understood the significance of having a "Goldilocks ratio". The importance of moderation and temperance in all the different facets of life was evident enough in the range of examples given by my group mates. With regards to the similarities of our virtues, they were really mostly intrapersonal by nature. I also think that we all mostly had the same ideas regarding temperance and where to draw the line in the extreme cases of our chosen virtues. That is, a virtue is deemed a vice when it sabotages either oneself or others. </p><p>However, the process of dictating whether harm is done can be very difficult to determine. For example, do we determine whether harm is done based on the action or the result (e.g. white lies, etc.)? While it\'s probably a case to case basis, I can personally say that these kinds of judgements don\'t come easily to me. However, as my chosen virtue is being optimistic, I think that it\'s best to remember that we aren\'t alone in these endeavors and that we will always have people around us to help better ourselves.</p>')
