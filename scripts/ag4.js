Aquinas said that the there are two kinds of law where the universe and all of its dynamic operate: natural law (secular) and eternal law (religious). The natural law pertains to doing something or learning something without actually believing in Jesus, while eternal law is the opposite. He generalized intelligence among the people, saying that one can have wisdom and knowledge without no interest, no knowledge to or no strong faith in Jesus. Aquinas is also known for the concept of “reason” where he said that not everything can be explored by just faith, but also reason. </p><p>The relevance of this view of Aquinas is that: (1) it opens the idea that not all great ideas come from Christians but also from those people who have a different belief and faith; (2) one can acquire knowledge independently in any way possible; (3) the natural law somehow promotes equality since wisdom does not depend on the social status, religion, belief, etc. of a particular person; (4) lastly, it shows us that knowledge and wisdom come from several sources, may it be from natural law (scientific, based on books, technology, or innovations) or from eternal law (teachings of God, the church or from monks).</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>The School of Life.

Augustine believes it was the rise of Roman’s corruption and desire to dominate that lead to the demise of the seemingly unbreakable empire. He commented that the man\'s intrinsic goodness was tainted with the original sin of the first people on earth - Adam and Eve. Thus, humans can never attain perfect order as we all succumb into worldly desires. This then encourages not to worry much in this perfect order (since we certainly cannot by nature) but instead focus on atoning for our sins and live righteously.</p><p>This sin results to eternal damnation we are all destined to be but there is hope. Augustine believes that through the grace of God there is salvation. This then separates the righteous and the unrighteous when the Kingdom of God comes – the heavenly city and the earthly city. Augustine refers justice as the relation of God to man and this brings peace. Meanwhile, although Augustine believes on the separation of church and state, he said that the state brings good through providing social order and peace that makes service to God possible.</p><p>In relation to Rome’s fate, this offers a possible explanation of the current state of the world today and perhaps a consequence of what we have already achieved as a society, that is, we have evolved from “an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth” form of justice to a more morally acceptable system.</p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, William, and Alan O.

Moreover, he believed that God selects who to save, and the rest would continue to be sinners who will be punished after death in hell.</p><p>View of the State and Church</p><p>According to him, the state’s primary function is to maintain peace, and within the state are materialistic and pleasure-seeking humans. On the other hand, the church serves as the representative of God on earth.</p><p>View on the Salvation</p><p>He believed that God must initiate salvation, and we will not be saved if we will not live in accordance to our Christian faith. Additionally, salvation cannot be gained only by following the examples of Jesus and the saints, but rather, it requires the inner soul to be renewed by the free grace from God.</p><p>View on Justice</p><p>Justice for him cannot be achieved if people would not believe in God, for justice is found in His words and love. Furthermore, justice produces harmony within the society, and it begins within each person.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Marc Cyrel Magnawa</i></h4><p>View of Human Nature</p><p>St. Augustine separates humans into those who live in accordance to human laws, and those in accordance to God\'s laws. The former is a person who lets their lust for power and other worldly things spread evil (but some righteous ones have desires that do not match Christian beliefs), while the latter is a transformed person who lives a life of devotion to God and temporarily lives to later on be admitted to the heavenly kingdom.</p><p>View of the State and the Church</p><p>The church is as a symbol of the City of God. They serve as guides to the gateway of the heavenly kingdom. The state, on the other hand, deals with the conflicts between humans; it functions to preserve peace and mediate conflicts in the City of Man, but is unfortunately imperfect due to the limitations of human judgment.</p><p>View on the Salvation</p><p>Salvation for St. Augustine can be achieved when someone lives by faith of God, lives alongside the earthly kingdom, follows the Christian teachings, and seeks blessings promised from the heavenly kingdom after their temporary life on Earth.</p><p>View on Justice</p><p>Justice manifests when everything is in its natural order, particularly when humans obey the laws of God. When this natural order is preserved, there is peace, and justice follows when there is peace, for justice is administering what is necessary to maintain peace and preserve the order.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>John Samuel Suico</i></h4><p>Here\'s a draft of my explanations regarding St. Augustine\'s ideas.</p><p><b>View of Human Nature</b></p><p>Human beings are born with an innate sinful nature brought about by the fall of man (i.e. the "original sin" at the Garden of Eden). Our human tendency to serve our own interest and commit sin cannot be sufficiently reined in by reason, but requires the divine grace of God to overcome.</p><p><b>View of the State and Church</b></p><p>Man\'s natural and strong inclination to sin meant that laws should be strictly put in place by the State to keep us in check. The State was an instrument of divine justice but should also focus on creating opportunities for Christian virtues to flourish. The Church and the State are to be separate, but the Church should give sound advice to the rulers of the State. However, people are to obey the State regardless of their brand of justice.</p><p><b>View on Salvation</b></p><p>Augustine believed in the doctrine of predestination, meaning to say that God, in his omniscience, has already chosen people who will be saved. However, the sovereignty of God is reconciled with the idea of human agency and free will by understanding that God has given us free will to choose our actions, and therefore we are responsible for our own sins. Thus, God has already chosen people who He knows will choose to follow Him. The sinful nature of humans mean that we are in need of salvation, and that salvation comes by God\'s grace (which leads to repentance and faith) and is not guaranteed by participation in the church nor even faith (i.e. faith does not necessarily guarantee salvation).</p><p><b>View on Justice</b></p><p>True justice comes from our love of Christ, from which comes our love for other people. That love for others allows us to treat them justly ("assign to each his due"). </p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>[1] Political Philosophy. (2019, August 10).
