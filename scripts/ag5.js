He must listen to the needs of his people, especially if he imposes lockdowns that everyone, including the local governments are not fully prepared for. He must consider its effects on the people’s livelihood, food, and health.</p><p>Moreover, he must be strict when implementing rules regardless of their status, most especially with his allies, because his selectiveness and the clear differences in treatment would make his people doubt him and his ability to lead. He may enforce punishments but with clear guidelines on who and how they should receive it to ensure these rules would not be ignored.</p><p>Furthermore, the president should imbibe scientific data and researches provided by experts in creating a sustainable intervention plan to control the spread of the virus. He must efficiently propagate proven data in order to avoid possible misconceptions regarding  actions that should and should not taken during these times. Additionally, he should create a strict system that addresses issues on individuals who spread falsified messages which could potentially endanger his subjects.</p><p>Machiavelli would insist that dealing with a health crisis would really require a strict but fair, competent and efficient leader, and not someone who just waits for other countries to offer help— from the vaccine down to money, for his own country.</p><p><b>Part Two</b> (Question 2):</p><p>According to Machiavelli, it is the prince’s responsibility to defend the state from both internal and external threats, but in his rule, he should avoid being too loved nor too feared by his own people. The former since it may cause people to think he is incompetent, inefficient or too easy to disobey; while the latter because people may find him too cruel that he would be subject to hatred. However, if the prince cannot be both loved and feared, then the prince should rather be feared (reasonably cruel), but only for the sake of political effectiveness. </p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Rowill Christian Rempillo</i></h4><p><b>Part One</b>:</p><p>I somehow agree with Machiavelli’s views on politics. I agree that there’s an extent up to when a leader can be kind. There are some cases that need to dealt with in-depth discussions to determine if someone should be subject to certain sanctions. These sanctions should only be brought into discussion if necessary. Although I agree with his views, the sanctions should still be humanitarian – not cruel. Like the discussions on death penalty in the Philippines – it should still have the respect to human life. I would advise the president to act professionally by weighing his decisions for the country, not driven by political disputes because it has always resulted to injustices. For his reputation today, I admit, most people would fear him or won’t go against him, but you can’t silence the people for so long. Instead of implementing strict and abusive policies, leading a drug war that resulted to a bloodbath and endless cursing of the criminals or personal enemies, why not strengthen and enhance the justice system in the country? Why not put into position those who have already proved their reputations in the name of justice? Why not provide benefits and listen to the country’s scientists and healthcare professionals instead of dispersing armed forces to maintain order in the masses? Why not, possibly for the first time, we lean more on aiding our countrymen, rather than constantly building up that masculine reputation?</p><p><b>Part Two</b> (Question 2):</p><p>Machiavelli’s views on politics suggests a sense of balance in leadership. The type of leadership a prince should show to his people is a balance between two extremes – not to kind and not too cruel. Being loved by his own people would somehow be a weakness or a fragile point in his leadership. There are people who aren’t scared of having their hands dirty for the sake of gaining power or dominance. On the other hand, being too feared by his own people would result to overthrowing his governance. IT may result to coup, revolutions and chaos. It will come to a point where the people are driven by hatred and desire to have less fearful rulers and resistance is the only choice they have. </p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Marc Cyrel Magnawa</i></h4><p><b>Part One</b>:</p><p>The pandemic has caused disorder in everyday life, and so it is necessary to mitigate its effects so that the country may return to normalcy faster. Applying Machiavelli\'s philosophy, one advice I could give would be to maintain strict curfews and have harsher punishments for those who can but refuse to participate in flattening the curve. In exchange, more benefits should be given to front liners to balance out the harshness of these stricter policies. While it is cruel to forcibly limit one\'s freedom in travelling, a tamer version of this is already in effect; to survive, the state must conquer COVID-19 by minimizing its spread so we might as well go all out in its prevention. Using Machiavelli\'s philosophy, these somewhat extreme actions are justifiable so long as the president succeeds in warding off the disease, but this could create more political tension since previous attempts of the president to exercise even more power has generated bad reputation and unsuccessful results at appeasing the critics. Therefore, careful thought of the trade-offs must be considered when this advice is to be taken seriously.</p><p><b>Part Two</b> (Question 3):</p><p>As extreme as Machiavelli\'s amorality is, I at least subscribe to the idea that certain principles will inevitably be suspended at dire situations. It is easy to think that ethics is well-defined, in that it is always about the good versus the evil. In reality, much of morality is a gray area, and we have to face really difficult situations. It may even come that sacrifices must be made, and morality must be abandoned to prevent more tragic consequences. From Machiavelli\'s philosophy, it is reasonable that no benevolent ruler can last, and even the kindest of rulers must make difficult decisions and be willing to get their hands dirty, lest their indecision leads to a much greater evil that could have been avoided.</p><hr><h4>Post by <i>Abigail Bait-it</i></h4><p><b>Part One</b>:</p><p>I strongly believe that Filipinos are innately obedient, so long as rules were clear and their implementations are not fluctuating. In fact, 91% of Filipinos wear masks when they go out[1]. So, as an apprentice of Machiavelli, fear of authority is already checked in the list. However, I will already say that most of Machiavelli’s beliefs in his The Prince were not applicable to the country as it was really meant for a monarch and the unification of Italy. Further, I don’t agree with the justifications of cruelty and relativity of evil.</p><p>In a medical emergency like this, it is important that the leader must act swiftly. Thus, it matters not to just wait for the vaccine but do something that is backed by scientific principles. Machiavelli believes that it is fine to use some cruelty to keep people in check, yet as we can see now, most of our leaders are “uselessly cruel and arrogant”. To quote: “for to incur hatred without any advantage is the greatest temerity and imprudence” [2].</p><p>We’ve witnessed how the administration shut down one of the biggest media company while allowing the rise of a foreign telecommunications company, dumped some sands to Manila Bay albeit the experts’ warnings, continuous red-tagging especially to the youth, all during a medical crisis.</p><p>Machiavelli also believes that the ruler must trust the public more than the nobility. I would suggest this to the president as this must really be the case in a democratic country, isn’t it? The public is more aware of their difficulties and needs and they are, after all, the people the government should serve.</p><p><b>Part Two</b> (Question 2):</p><p>For Machiavelli, it is important for a leader to be both feared and loved. Since this is hard, it is then better to be feared but to extent that the ruler is not hated by the people. Being too loved brings the ruler to his own prison of goodness making him indecisive and inefficient because he cannot sacrifice the lives of others for the benefit of others. He goes on to say that morality can be a hindrance. Being too feared, on the other hand, may bring hatred to the people which would eventually cause the ruler\'s downfall as well. Machiavelli endorses cruelty so long as it is justified. He believes that fear keeps people in check but too much will result in people\'s revolution. He said that love binds people with obligation which is loose, but fear brings dread of punishment.</p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>[1] Baron, G.

I think that, for the most part, Duterte\'s actions can be placed under the framework of a Machiavellian take on politics (except for the blatant stupidity and obscurantism often times presented by his office). When I analyze the current steps his administration has considered, it seems that he is more concerned with the retention of power than truly doing what is best for his constituents. He\'s kept his generals paid well, and he\'s tried to control the media as best as he can to ensure rampant support of presidential fanatics who do not listen well to reason. However, I also think that he\'s failed miserably in preventing outrage and divisiveness amongst the people, especially with his current responses to the pandemic and the lack of concrete plans to deal with it. In that sense, Machiavellian philosophy has failed our country due to the administration\'s poor execution of it.</p><p><b>Part Two</b> (Question 2):</p><p>A prince should avoid being too loved nor too feared by his people, because either extreme prevents its own set of problems. When someone is too loved by his people, this is often due to the benefits the administration presents to them during the present time. However, when under duress and placed with the fear of losing one\'s property, the people will be quick to revolt since love per se is not obligatory but born out of flimsy (according to Machiavelli) servitude. The same outcome is true when being too feared, since hatred by the populace will lead to collective action, the bane of the ruling class, driven by their mutual hatred of the government\'s inability to perform and serve the people.</p>')
