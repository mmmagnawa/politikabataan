And the invader again is in the like danger of another.”</i> (Hobbes 1651 as cited in Ebeinstein and Ebeinstein 1999/2000, p. 407)</p><p><b>Relevance</b>: This quote pretty much summarizes Hobbes’ State of Nature. The State of Nature is described somewhat alike of the earliest periods, without civilizations or concept of society. People at this state aren’t governed by a central authority, hence, they handle things on their own hands. The concept of individualism is somehow portrayed in this state where a man has full responsibility of protecting himself, fighting for the fruits of his labour, or his life. There is chaos and war which is driven by selfishness, conservation of one’s life or dominion on others’. Hobbes also illustrated the state of nature as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” (Hobbes 1651 as cited in Ebeinstein and Ebeinstein 1991, p. 408).</p><p>Every man is an enemy of every man, and they can only depend on their strength for their safety. In a time where no industry or no concept of knowledge, no technological innovations and advancements, the fear of being deprived of life, brutally or not, is the only constant and certain thing that you’ll ever live with.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, W. &amp; Ebenstein, A.

As we possess our own beliefs and values, we can also establish within ourselves the purpose of our lives, what do we pursue, and how and whom to spend it with, such that in every turn we can make it a critical point of our track. Hence we can also acknowledge change, either within ourselves or in our environment.</p><p>Nevertheless, we should never forget our own responsibilities as human beings that this freedom entails. We should not abuse it. We should still be careful and sensitive of our words (especially when expressing our opinions) and our actions.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, W. &amp; Ebenstein, A.

The man of nature knows less medicine than civilized man, but the latter brings upon himself more diseases than medicine can cure.”</i> (Hobbes 1651 as cited in Ebeinstein and Ebeinstein 1999/2000, p. 496)</p><p><b>Relevance</b>: Jean-Jacques Rousseau views the state of nature as a simple and healthy environment where people live a satisfied life – has access to their basic needs and does not seek more out of greed. The quote implies that as civilization was introduced to this state of nature, the contented and simple life was disrupted. People have been seeking more and competitions between one another has been evident – these are the evils that civilization has produced. Pride, greed and jealousy has existed and in simpler terms, the minds of the people have been corrupted by ills and prejudices. The second line of the quote tells us the severity of the negative effects of civilization. The effects have turned into sins and vices that people can’t easily escape from because they tend to eagerly seek more and more each day. In the modern times, when one is in power, he/she tends to be blinded by the realities and purpose of life, forgets to be compassionate just like the person he/she was back then, and tends to acquire more and more power to satisfy his greed, and personal needs and aspirations. He/she forgets the point of contentment and satisfaction – the basics of human life.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, W. &amp; Ebenstein, A. O. (1991).

For it is a voluntary act: and of the voluntary acts of every man the object is some good to himself … The mutual transferring of rights is that which men call contract.”</i></p><p><b>Relevance</b>: The absence of political order in a self-interested State of Nature society led to the creation of a social contract. The quote shows that this contract came from the communal and voluntary act of men when then came to the understanding that they should limit their right of nature, although first for the good of himself, but consequently for the good of all when the social contract led to the establishment of a state that would create rules and regulations, and maintain order within the society.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, W. &amp; Ebenstein, A.

In an effort to avoid this, in what Locke ultimately envisions as a state of war, it is necessary to impose a social contract to control possible clashing intentions and to unify independent goals to transform them into societal goals that will have a consensus as to how best the society will be able to manage transgressions effectively, without tampering on the each other\'s rights, and establishing a symbiotic relationship between the state, its citizens and within interpersonal relations. It is then akin to a safety net for the state of nature of mankind. Thus, realigning individuals by means of mutual agreements in a social contract reduces, if not eradicates, the degradation of society into a state of war.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, W. &amp; Ebenstein, A.

As such, when faced with insurmountable odds against their individual powers of self-preservation, people can choose to come together and unite under a common motivation, surrendering their natural liberties for rights they can exercise without obstructing anyone else’s freedom (i.e. liberties based on conventions and agreements). Rousseau’s conception of a social contract is the idea of a General Will that legitimizes itself and is derived from the common will of the people to form an “individual” popular sovereignty — one that can only act in the interest of the people simply by virtue of its conception. The sovereign’s duty is to “compel people to be free” by means of securing their conventional liberties and ensuring that its subjects will follow the General Will instead of pursuing their own independent interests.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, William and Alan Ebenstein. 1991.

His wisdom and judgement must not be questioned, and power is concentrated to him alone (or to a group of men but there is no division of powers among them). His purpose is to provide peace and common defence by whatever means necessary and convenient so long as he does not harm their "jus naturale" or right to self-preservation.</p><p>The election of the Leviathan is through the consent of its subjects, a mutual covenant, but not including the Leviathan as he is just a consequence of the contract. To quote: "I authorize and give up my right of governing myself, to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition, that thou give up thy right to him, and authorize all his actions in like manner." [p. 412]. The rationality of man convinced him that cooperation is needed and that giving up his rights of governing himself provides security, a fair trade.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, W. &amp; Ebenstein, A.

As the people enter civil society, "they give up all their natural power", that is, by the virtue of the natural law everyone has a right to judge their own conflicts and execute a penalty. Although the natural law obliges everyone not to harm another\'s "life, health, liberty, or possessions" [p436], this unwritten law is not clear, susceptible to man\'s bias, and dependent on man\'s capacity to execute the sentence. This deficiency in the law of the state of nature calls for the formation of a new social contract. The community, then, establishes a government through a fiduciary trust agreement that would enable the formation of an "organized law and order" [p429].</p><p>For Locke absolute monarchy is worse than the state of nature in contrast to Hobbes\' perception of political leadership. Whereas Hobbes\' Leviathan rules autonomously, Locke separated the government into three branches: the legislative, executive, and federative where the legislative reigns supreme. The people, however, are above the government. He emphasized that the duty of government is "for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties, and estates, which I call by the general name, property." [p446]. Failure to comply, the people have the right to remove, alter, or even dissolve the government and create a new one.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, W. &amp; Ebenstein, A.

Unlike Hobbes\' Leviathan as the absolute ruler, Rousseau believes that the whole citizenry directed towards the common good, which he called the General Will, possesses and authenticates the sovereign power. Every citizen who entered the social contract is part of the legislative assembly and thus, shares a role in law-making and decision-making. </p><p>Rousseau\'s concern is how to unite individual liberty with security. He thinks that an individual is free if he can do whatever he wants. He possesses this right in the state of nature, but gives it up in exchange for a more certain and secure civil and moral liberty. Thus, an individual is only free even if a law limits him if he made or contributed in the political process. Regarding the executive and judiciary aspect, Rousseau assigned these tasks to a separate institution consisting of wise men that will enact and oversee the laws made by the legislative, that is, the people.</p><p>Thus, to Rousseau the goal is</p><p><i>"... to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before"</i> [p509, Ebenstein and Ebenstein]</p><p>This is relevant as he values the individuality (which includes passions, own views, among others) of each citizen, in contrast to Hobbes\' total surrender for peace and order. Further, the people indeed know their needs and interests. Lastly, he emphasized on the active participation and responsibility of every citizen in politics and refuses complacency.</p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, W. &amp; Ebenstein, A.

It also highlights the fact that the natural right to self-preservation is of a much higher priority than the goals of the Leviathan.</p><p>Hobbes\' Leviathan, as powerful as it is, cannot step on its subjects\' rights to self-preservation. In such situations where an individual could be harmed, or at worst killed, by the Leviathan\'s order, the individual is allowed to resist the Leviathan\'s rule. This right to self-preservation can never be surrendered or taken away by the Leviathan. The Leviathan is also only absolute insofar as it achieves its goal of maintaining peace, order, and security; the Leviathan can be tolerable to other liberties in life (such as choice of occupation and personal property) so long as it does not impede in achieving the Leviathan\'s goals.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, William and Alan Ebenstein. 1991.

For Locke, property is a broad and encompassing term which includes life, liberty, and personal possessions. The government cannot, in any circumstance, deny anyone the right to their property, nor can the government forcibly take one\'s property away from them.</p><p>For Locke, there are four key limits to the power given to the government. First, all policies must apply to all and not be arbitrary. Second, these policies are only legitimate if it is for the common good. Third, a person\'s property cannot be taken away from them without consent. Finally, the duty of legislation cannot be transferred from the legislative without having consent from the people.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, William and Alan Ebenstein. 1991.

Any such deviation to this (such as a law being willed by an individual and not by the collective people) no longer constitutes general will and as such is not legitimized by it.</p><p>In Rousseau\'s version of the social contract, the sovereign power of the people is absolute and so any legislation must be guided by their general will. All decisions must be made with the intent of being for the common good of the people. In addition, Rousseau discouraged representation because they cannot always represent the voices of the community; instead each member of political society must actively participate in creating the policies that they themselves will obey.</p><p>Because decision-making is guided by the general will, any policy that goes against it is seen as illegitimate and therefore should be discarded in favor of a policy that better represents the needs of the populace. In other words, political power is limited to the decision-making and enactment of policies that are aimed for the common good of the people in society.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, William and Alan Ebenstein. 1991.

The masses protested against the cessation of the network for a variety of reasons including livelihood, history of service, and dissemination coverage. Since the permission to operate was denied, they have followed suit to abide by the decision.</p><p>Now, during this integral moment of informing the masses, the government appeals to the media for its information dissemination but has lost significant rural radio coverage that is monopolized by ABS-CBN\'s radio network. Even if one has followed agreements and systems perfectly, to turn a blind eye to the opinions of those affected by the cessation has now impeded the government of their ability to abide by their own obligation to protect its citizens by disabling the information network.</p><p>The government believes in sticking to stipulations while having the privilege to remain oblivious to objections, at least in this case, but without a full assessment, the ramifications of that decision may lead to the irony of disabling your own capability to stick to the stipulations you established yourself, such as the example shown here.</p><div class="references"><p><b>References</b></p><ul><li>Buan, Lian. 2020.

When therefore our refusal to obey frustrates the end for which the sovereignty was ordained, then there is no liberty to refuse: otherwise there is."</i> <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>  (Ebenstein and Ebenstein 1991, p. 419)</p><p><b>Relevance</b>: Multiple controversies and philosophically charged debates have erupted within our different social spheres amidst the governance of our incumbent President Duterte. One such controversy is his campaign for the war on drugs and the blatant use of the military police to end the lives of the supposed criminal entities - the drug addicts. I want to draw the focus of this quote to the people who are enacting these atrocities: the police and vigilantes. Does the murder of the supposed drug addicts, children and civilians, benefit the goals of the state? Problematizing this even further: why are the majority of killings within poverty-ridden sectors?<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup> Is this the answer as to how the state should secure peace, order, and security and progress towards a more commodious living, when much more pressing issues face us in our everyday lives (i.e. food security, job security, lack of industrialization, environmental degradation, etc.)? We must understand that it is not our position and post in society that defines the limits of our actions, but the intention by which these actions were ordained. To this effect, educating our fellow citizens by inciting discussions and creating discourse remains severely important that we may all act with a greater political will for true societal progress.</p><p><h6 id="fn1"><a href="#ref1">[1]</a> Hobbe\'s rigorous exposition on the limits of the sovereign\'s power based on the inalienable right to self-preservation is visibly clear cut when reading the Leviathan. However, this particular quote underlines the responsibility of the sovereign to enact upon the goals of the state (i.e. peace, order, and security), the failure of which warrants the liberty of man to refuse obedience. The actual process of determining whether the Leviathan\'s actions are subservient to the end for which it was ordained cannot be judicial by nature, since the source of the law is the commonwealth, but its veracity must be determined by the same circular logic that Hobbe\'s uses regarding civil law (i.e. by definition): that the Leviathan was created to enjoy the security of life, and not live in fear of it being taken away.</h6></p><p><h6 id="fn2"><a href="#ref2">[2]</a> Killings occur in impoverished areas; the majority of murdered individuals lie at the bottom rung of the drug ladder.

The pervading culture against rallying, for example, is that it\'s a socially disruptive and improper means of expressing discontent (when it is, in fact, an exercise of our constitutional right to gather in public assembly). We refuse to problematize the rampant pervading culture of poverty, traffic, environmental degradation, loss of indigenous tribe\'s ancestral lands, and a host of other systemic injustices. We mustn\'t forget that the government and the constitution exists to protect and represent the interests of its constituents.

This principle is a direct attack against the avarice dominant in modern capitalism. Many corporations are driven by greed and so they may attempt to exploit the consumer by artificially inflating prices or using unfavorable business practices, or resort to exploiting their workers so that costs of production may be further reduced. Regardless, this results in the unfair distribution of wealth where the economic elites hoard their wealth and do nothing to improve the conditions of the rest of society that needs it.</p><p>This also interestingly speaks against corruption in all aspects of the government. Local government authorities may intentionally overspend or misdeclare expenditures so that they could keep some of the tax money for themselves. Locke would be more inclined to call this as robbery, since corrupt authorities already earn a substantial amount for themselves, but they continue to take more than what they need. They are effectively taking more than their share, letting the money spoil (not be used for improving infrastructures).</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, William and Alan Ebenstein. 1991.

Should there be a potential threat to this clause, upon the powers granted to the General Will and the governing authority, it may be mandatory to force the individual/s to comply.</p><p>The issue remains true even when the rules begin to change, such is the case when a bill that advocates divorce as a legal course of action is approved by the Committee on Population and Family Relations of the Philippine House of Representatives (Guerra , 2020). It may be true that the bill is gaining positive traction, but it is still not an active and fully approved law. Thus, despite the injustice upon women’s rights, the community has no choice but to dismiss any pleas of marital separation. However, should this bill be engraved within the constitution, it will then be part of the set of rules and regulations that the General Will encompasses. In such a case, the opposition to the bill shall now be forced to withdraw their clashing impositions on those that opt to apply the law to their situation.</p><div class="references"><p><b>Reference</b></p><ul><li>Ebenstein, William and Alan Ebenstein. 1991.
