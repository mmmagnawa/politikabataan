Much of his works are a synthesis of Aristotle’s rediscovered works, which he used as an instrument to reaffirm the institutionalization of Christianity. Unlike the Augustinian preference to Plato, St. Thomas needed something that was more adaptable and can stand the test of time, which is exhibited by the inquisitive yet careful writings of Aristotle. The flexibility of Aristotle allowed Christianity as a religion to persevere through the ages. It was also vital that St. Thomas combined faith and reason through scholasticism so that Christianity would be more resistant to arguments from humanism; human reasoning was becoming so popular that he had to incorporate it into the Christian doctrine instead of reject it altogether.</p> <p>St. Thomas was devoted to Christianity, so much so that he was compelled to write a series of books that explain the principle beliefs of Christianity and use it to discuss important topics in humanity. He was able to do so since he was exposed to the Christian life early on by the mendicant Dominicans, who compelled him to stay away from his aristocratic life. This early devotion fueled his long and triumphant attempt to reconcile Aristotelian thought with Christian beliefs.</p> <h4>View on Human Nature</h4> <p>Humans possess reasoning so as to participate in implementing God’s eternal law in the world (namely the natural law). Because of this, humans have an innate sense of goodness in them. This, however, is not enough to achieve ultimate goodness because human reasoning has its limitations. This limitation can only be perfected through God’s guidance, either through the teachings of Christianity or through divine revelation in the form of the Bible. St. Thomas reconciled reason and faith by stating that faith stands more superior than reason but they are complementary; reason guided with faith is the best type of person for St. Thomas.</p> <p><b>Relevance:</b> This affirmation of reasoning with faith shows that there is no conflict between religious beliefs and logic. This naturally extends to the domains of both science and religion, in that science tries to understand the world and religion provides the context that cannot be explained by science. A lot of extremist views on science versus religion fail to acknowledge this and instead disposes one in favor of another without realizing that it is perfectly fine for them to coexist. St. Thomas reminds us that we need both and not just one or the other and that these types of arguments are completely meaningless.</p> <h4>View on Salvation</h4> <p>There are various forms of salvation, which for St. Thomas is the achievement of that which is good and is worth pursuing. There are material goods that humans are better off trying to obtain, such as wealth and virtue, while the ultimate good of being with God is far more valuable than any material goods. This form of salvation is worth pursuing because it transcends the mortal appetite and leads to eternal happiness.</p> <p><b>Relevance:</b> St. Thomas tells us that we must seek for the good that is beyond ourselves. This salvation is a strong driving force for propagating good in the world, especially in times of grievance where seemingly all is lost. Majority of people in the Philippines suffer through poverty, but their character and devotion to God makes them richer than the oligarchs that run the country, for they enjoy their wealth of being with God in the afterlife. This, in a way, gives the idea that we should strive to be like these people who do good despite all odds.</p> <h4>View on State and Church</h4> <p>St. Thomas views the church as superior to the state, as the state merely aims to achieve the common good and maintain order, whereas the church seeks to achieve the ultimate good of being with God. However, it is not possible to aim for the final goal without first maintaining peace in the community, so the government must first seek the needs of the common good while being advised by the church.</p> <p><b>Relevance:</b> It is quite common to hear conflicts between the church and the state, especially when it concerns controversial policies. While it is certainly true that the government may want to enact practical policies that go against the teachings of the church, and that the church tries to warn the administration of the consequences of undermining their doctrines, it is necessary that they work together to unify the citizens rather than divide them based on the strength of their faith. Moreover, the church must assist the state in preventing the implementation of unjust laws that would lead to suffering. As the saying goes, not all that is legal is moral, but then again, modern perspectives tend to go against the timeless and unchanging teachings of religion.</p>")
