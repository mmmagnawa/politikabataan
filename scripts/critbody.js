document.write("<p>Critical thinking is such a diverse concept that branches out on almost everything that we deal with on a daily basis. It’s so broad and it can be applied to various and distinct situations. But simply speaking, critical thinking is a systematic and fact-based thinking that examines and synthesizes unverified and complex information to come up with a more meaningful and relevant information for the benefit of a person, group or most importantly, the general public.</p> <p>“The unexamined life is not worth living , because they realize that many unexamined lives together result in an uncritical, unjust, dangerous world.” (Elder, 2007).</p> <p>Fake news, on the other hand, is just literally fake-news – unverified info, misinformation, hoaxes, etc. Fake news can be very detrimental to the society, especially in a community with a large number of the population coming from the youth. With the advent of social media, misinformation seems like a virus that plagues the minds of the people and the only vaccine is fact-checking through critical thinking. The spread of false information, which occasionally might seem harmless in its inception, always has the potential to become malicious and even life threatening to the people who believe it.</p> <p>As timely as it can get, some of the fake news or false information that our group has noticed are information regarding the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19)&mdash;killing the virus, preventing widespread infection, etc. One of these was President Rodrigo Duterte’s note on washing facemasks with gasoline and reusing it. There has been no proof that washing masks with diesel and gasoline can help sterilize it for the purpose of reusing the mask. Another is the ill-informed information circulating in social media regarding the killing of viruses by consuming more alkaline food. There has been no proof or substantial evidence from the authority that these methods work against the virus.</p> <p>Ask yourself this question, what if people neglected fact-checking and proceeded on doing these things? Will there be no consequences? Of course, there is! Especially that it’s centered on health, consequences can range from being hospitalized, life-long illness or worse, death.</p> <p>For time-independent versions of fake news, the group has distinguished three undeniable examples&mdash;misinformation in science communication, deceiving information of life hacks and crafts, and the never ending chain messages. Science communication is arguably one of the most common roots of fake news. Details are often twisted by journalists just to make it sound more appealing – overall, it’s leaning more on aesthetic than substance. Main problem is, the information is crucial because it’s scientific data. And then there’s the deceiving life hacks and chain messages. The details just seem very convincing. But then again, when you indulge deeper into it, you’ll eventually realize that it’s just a waste of time and the contents are certainly misleading.</p> <p>Lastly, the explicit use of names of educational institutions and continuous red-tagging on students, activists and movements. As an ever growing information database, the internet is home to a plethora of various data. With the overwhelming amount of freedom an individual has to access these data, one should be careful in determining its credibility.</p> <p>Social media networks have become one of the most powerful concepts in the 21st century. These platforms have liberalized the process of information dissemination into a democratic setting where people have the power to consume, produce, and share as much information as anyone else (Nagi, 2018).</p> <p>It is easy for people to be misled and manipulated by adding a credible source in claims but, in turn, it makes it significantly harder for society to sift through the truth of reality and diminishes the habit of proper academic resource dissemination in the process. Critical thinking bridges the gap between misinformation and fact-based information circulation.</p> <p>Just because no one’s held accountable for fake news, doesn’t mean you have to be fine with it. Spreading fake news is NOT a trend. Fact-checking is one. Let’s also make that a habit.</p>");
