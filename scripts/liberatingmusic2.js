document.write("<p>Jeniffer Lopez’s song <i>Ain’t Your Mama</i>  embodies JS Mill’s efforts to pursue gender equality in his work <i> The Subjection of Women</i> . The song talks about the expectations placed on women to essentially function as domestic workers and coddle their husbands. The music video of the song speaks volumes about gender inequality within both private and public spheres of life, touching on topics such as the gender pay gap and occupational inequality. This comes as a rebuke to the status quo of society’s normalized views and expectations of women’s labour to be unceremoniously exploited and used by men. JS Mill recognizes that these inequalities should be addressed in our pursuit of an egalitarian society which would give way to more robust functions for the cohesive improvement of society. </p>");
