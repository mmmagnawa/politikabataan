The former since it could be seen as a weakness, causing people to think he is incompetent, inefficient or too easy to disobey; while the latter because people may find him too cruel that he would be subject to hatred, hence resulting to chaos, resistance, and revolutions. Nevertheless accounting the difficulty to achieve this balance, the prince should then rather be feared due to justified cruelty for the sake of political effectiveness.</p><p> One of the main ideas of Machiavelli’s political philosophy in The Prince is priority of political effectiveness over other manners. In that aspect, this group believes that an effective Philippine president must be capable of managing the country and making decisions that would allow society to survive and prosper. For instance, under the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus is considered an enemy of the state; the president must respond quickly and effectively to control this biological enemy and minimize its harm. </p> <p>The public is more aware of their difficulties and needs and they are, after all, the people the government should serve. Hence, he must listen to the needs of his people, especially if he imposes lockdowns that everyone, including the local governments are not fully prepared for. He must consider all its effects on the people’s livelihood, food, and health. One may argue that completely shutting down economy to prioritize healthcare would be disastrous to society, but in this case we have to prioritize the survival of Philippine society; economic development and other business interests will have to be sacrificed lest we end up overloading the limited medical resources (hospitals, doctors, medicine, other medical staff) and letting even more people suffer.<p>It is important to maintain strict curfews and have sanctions for those who refuse to participate in flattening the curve such as requiring personal protective equipment and maintaining social distancing, since these policies are ultimately for the good of everyone. To ensure that these are successfully implemented, it may be necessary to impose harsher punishments for everyone to comply, and relax these policies if the situation has improved. Additionally, these rules must strictly be implemented regardless of status, most especially with his allies, because his selectiveness and the clear differences in treatment would make his people doubt him and his ability to lead. He must then enforce humanitarian—rather than simply cruel—punishments but with clear guidelines on who and how they should receive it.</p><p>Additionally, the president should imbibe scientific data and research provided by experts in creating a sustainable intervention plan to control the spread of the virus. He must efficiently propagate proven data in order to avoid possible misconceptions regarding  actions that should and should not be taken during these times. Furthermore, he should create a strict system that addresses issues on individuals who spread falsified messages which could potentially endanger his subjects.</p><p>Moreover, the government has to be efficient in their ability to solve problems. Using the same example as before, the best move would be to focus on enhancing local vaccine research and providing more benefits to frontline workers, as that would help in detection and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This strategy is more resourceful than the current approach which involves deploying non-medical personnel to maintain community quarantine, which is effective but not of primary importance in fighting against COVID-19.</p><p>On another note, Machiavelli also considers a leader’s reputation to be important, as a good reputation would minimize political unrest and maintain public trust. In a democratic society such as the Philippines, it would be preferable for the president to cooperate with political rivals and be considerate of other branches of the government as a means to show good character. Good character is an admirable quality for a politician and also consequently improves reputation. Therefore, we would also advise the president to be more cooperative with important political figures such as the vice president instead of engaging in unimportant quarrels.</p><p>Lastly, even though Machiavelli has some beneficial ideas for improving Philippine society, some of his ideas may be too radical. For Machiavelli, a political leader’s end goal is acquisition, retention, and expansion of power, but treating power as an end itself could be problematic for the rest of society. During a significant crisis such as the pandemic, exercise of political power such as red-tagging activists that are against the actions of the government, militarization, and continuing the war on drugs would do nothing to improve the current problem of COVID-19; these actions are a waste of resources that should have been allocated to healthcare.</p>");
