The object that the group will be featuring is something that’s been very essential to our daily lives, with or without the pandemic – the laptop.</p> <p>We all are familiar with how it works, and we are well aware how it makes doing schoolwork or gaming more efficient. In this section, the group will be indulging deeper with the socioeconomic factors that come with the production of laptops.</p> <h4>Required Capital</h4> <p>Starting this business does not only require the supply of laptops, but also the office rent, labor costs, and other additional expenses. Acer, founded by Stan Shih, started the company with US$25,000 in capital as a company distributor of electronic components and a consultant of microprocessors. In 2017, Acer’s operating income has jumped to NT$3.670 billion. </p> <h4>Annual Revenue</h4> <p>From the list of top laptop companies in the 21st century, Dell’s annual revenue was $50 billion, Lenovo with $45 billion, HP with $53 billion, Microsoft with $90 billion and Apple with $230 billion. The laptops’ specifications, cons and pros have a big impact on the company's annual revenue. </p> <h4>Manpower</h4> <p>With the recent statistics on the number of employees, some of the laptop companies include: 300,000 professionals for Samsung, 120,000 employees for Microsoft, 18,000 employees for ASUS, 101,000 employees for Dell, 60,000 for Lenovo, and 120,000 employees for Apple. </p> <h4>Target Market</h4> <p>The target market of laptops mainly comprise of students in secondary schools and universities, and small to large business or office personnel. This is because of the need to perform work ranging from academic-related requirements up to business enterprise operations. </p> <h4>Usage</h4> <p>Due to its robust and efficient function, the share of households with a computer (including laptops) increased from 27.3% in 2005 to 49.7% in 2019 based on Statista. In 2019, the total sales for desktop computers was 88.4 million units. This is almost half of the total sales of laptops with 166 million. </p> <h4>Challenges and Issues</h4> <p>One major challenge for the laptop industry is the increasing demand in mobile and smartphones. Some advantages of using mobile phones include being more convenient, practical, easy-to-use and efficient. </p> <p>An issue for some laptop companies is the treatment to contract workers – increasing profit and manpower, while minimizing cost. Basically, contract workers are temporary workers that are hired for cases with a relative increase in the company’s workload or to cover for an on-leave employee. This could also mean unstable jobs and minimized-to-no benefits for these workers. Many tech industries, including Silicon Valley, are still hiring contract workers despite the fact that the employees have been long-time fighting for equal benefits and treatment for the contract workforce.</p> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p>The production of laptops have been very efficient in recent times, which is evident in the revenue and usage of the device. The production processes align with Smith and Ricardo’s theories regarding division of labor (companies established departments like marketing, technical, production, transportation, etc.), capital accumulation (company founders started making profit out component upgrades and eventually built a tech company), market size (it appeals to the majority of the population) and free trade (expanding scope both nationwide and worldwide). Laptops have been products of technology; and with the dynamic integration of technology to our daily lives, having access to laptops becomes more of a need than a privilege. Improving the processes involved in production, companies should start from their stakeholders, especially their employees. They should treat them better, come up with an arrangement that benefits both parties and implement a workplace where employees can work comfortably and efficiently. Companies should also adapt with the change and innovations in technology to be able to cater the needs and demands of the world’s growing population.</p>")
