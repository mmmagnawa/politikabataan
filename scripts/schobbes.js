He believed that humans are naturally vicious and they would be willing to kill other people for resources, since there is no universal law that restricts behavior that prevents this from happening. This state of war makes people fear for their lives; out of this fear they have decided to create a social contract that will protect them from others in exchange for limiting some of their freedoms.</p><p>This social contract empowers an entity known as the Leviathan, the absolute ruler of the state. The Leviathan may be an individual or an assembly that is decided upon by the people who created the social contract. This ruler, having limitless power, is allowed to do anything provided it is for the peace, order, and security of society, and that its actions do not violate anyone’s natural right to self-preservation. As the sole source of political power, any decisions made by the Leviathan are final and unquestionable, and this power cannot be restricted (with the exception of the indomitable right of an individual’s self-preservation); otherwise, the Leviathan would be ineffective in fulfilling its duty as a ruler. As for other aspects of society, the Leviathan may be more lenient; it may allow some liberties that do not impede with its primary objectives.</p><p>While such an authoritarian ruler does not exist in the current Philippine society, there are some aspects of this that remain to be relevant. For instance, the government may succeed in achieving its goals without giving consideration to those affected by their decisions, similar to how the Leviathan’s belief ought to be untainted by the opinions of its subjects so that the Leviathan would remain strong-willed. For a contemporary example, the Duterte administration succeeded in shutting down ABS-CBN and their motive for doing so is justified by their own opinions, but they have failed to address the aftermath of ABS-CBN’s employees who are now jobless, at a time when the country is facing natural disasters (Buan 2020).</p>");
