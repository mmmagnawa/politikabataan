document.write("<p>Locke’s state of nature is a state of inconvenience. He believed that humans would independently try to achieve their personal goals, but this is often too difficult to do alone. Moreover, it is possible that people would be forced to compete with each other in order to achieve the same goal. Since people would recognize that cooperation would allow them to achieve previously unattainable goals, and regulation would prevent violence in competing for the same resources, they decided to create a new social contract that can deliver both.</p><p>In this social contract, people would surrender their natural liberty which was present in the state of nature; In exchange, they would acquire new liberties that will be secured by a common elected government. This government is divided into the executive, legislative, and federal branches, with the legislative branch being the most important. The fiduciary trust agreement ensures that the legislation would enact policies that would benefit the people and be aimed for the common good. Whenever this no longer holds true, Locke recommends protest over revolution, but when it becomes excessive the people are allowed to dissolve the government and create a new one, without necessarily reverting back to the state of nature.</p><p>In modern context this reason for establishing and dissolving the government whenever it fails to uphold its duties is important for discussions of social and cultural controversies. Certain prejudices prevent the population from fully realizing such excessive violations of the fiduciary trust agreement on the government’s end, such as failure to protect personal property (specifically the lives and welfare of the impoverished and the injustices on the powerless); such problems are sufficient grounds for dissolution of the current governing administration at the very least. Locke’s social contract advocates for activism as a means to voice grievances but there is cause for serious concern if the act of demanding a fair bargain of the social contract results in unwarranted incrimination.</p>");
