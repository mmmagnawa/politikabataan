Rousseau’s stance on civilization was very counterculture because of the popularity of rationalism during the Enlightenment. He believed that man in the state of nature was peaceful, noble, and good as compared to the social pressures brought about by competition in civilized communities that gave fruit to vices such as jealousy and greed.</p><p>Rousseau saw the social contract as the giving up of people’s natural rights in exchange for security to experience civil liberties, or the freedom brought about by agreed conventions. The government’s function was to secure the people’s liberties and to act upon the General Will of the people. On the best form of governance, Rousseau believed in the political participation of everyone as a means of exercising their political freedom, and, to that effect, was in support of an elective aristocratic ruling (i.e. rule of the few) to allow people more freedom to exercise their liberties, while still keeping checks and balances in the system.</p><p>Rousseau describes the General Will of the people as the guiding principle of governance. The General Will legitimizes the actions of the government in its pursuit of the common good of the populace. Any actions that are not representative of, or are beneficial to, the common good of the people has no place in the embodiment of popular sovereignty. The shaping of these wills comes from the people’s pursuit of moral liberty which, in turn, gives birth to (but is also eventually guided by) the General Will. In contemporary times, the concept of the General Will has become very reminiscent of the accomplishments of the 1986 People Power Revolution which culminated in the overthrowing of the late, unpopular, fascist dictator President Ferdinand Marcos. The unified motive of the Filipino people to free themselves from the chains of despotism nullified all claims of legitimacy under the government of the Marcos regime and enabled a less violent transfer of power.</p>");
